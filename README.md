## Introduction
---

Road accidents remain a major concern worldwide, leading to significant social, economic, and public health consequences. The Road Accident Dashboard project aims to address this challenge by offering a comprehensive, data-driven platform that facilitates the visualization and analysis of road accident data. This dashboard is designed to assist public safety authorities, researchers, and policymakers in understanding accident trends, identifying high-risk areas, and implementing strategies to reduce accidents and enhance road safety.

## Data Sources

- Road Accident Dataset used for this project.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Raw data often has many inconsistencies like missing values, Duplicate records or inaccurate entries. So the data collected is preprocessed first. This includes

1. Handling missing or null values.
2. Remove Duplicates
3. Normalize data fields (e.g., standardizing time formats, location data).

## Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is used to gain deeper insights into the relationships between different variables like

- Investigating relationships between weather conditions, road types, and accident severity.
- Examining the distribution of accidents by severity (serious, slight, fatal).
- Understanding the overall number of accidents within different regions and timeframes.

## Visualization and Dashboard Creation (Using Excel)

The road accident data was visualized and analyzed using Excel, leveraging its powerful charting, pivot tables, and data visualization capabilities.

## Key Insights and Features

- Accident Hotspots - Through geospatial mapping, the dashboard enables users to visualize accident-prone areas, highlighting regions with the highest concentration of accidents. This feature provides valuable insights for authorities to implement targeted interventions in high-risk zones, helping to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents in those areas.

- Trend Analysis - By analyzing accident data over time, users can detect significant trends, such as monthly, seasonal, or yearly patterns. These insights are crucial for identifying periods of increased accident risk, allowing safety authorities to implement preventive measures during high-risk times.

- Severity of Accidents - Accidents are categorized based on severity- slight, serious, and fatal. Users can analyze the distribution of these severity categories across different regions, enabling authorities to prioritize resources and interventions in areas with a higher frequency of fatal accidents.

- Type of Vehicles Involved - The dashboard categorizes accidents based on the types of vehicles involved, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses. By analyzing the frequency of accidents by vehicle type, stakeholders can identify which vehicles are most at risk in different conditions and regions, leading to targeted safety campaigns or regulations for specific vehicle types.

- Contributing Factors - The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of factors contributing to accidents, including weather conditions, road types, and time of day. By understanding the key causes of accidents, stakeholders can address these specific issues and implement more effective safety initiatives, potentially reducing future accidents.
